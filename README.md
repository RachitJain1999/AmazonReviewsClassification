# AmazonReviewsVectorized

This py file is the python file i used to vectorize a database that had a text field in order to predict the score.

The actual database could not be uploaded as it is too large. You can download it from kaggle, where it is by the name of "AMAZON FINE FOOD REVIEWS

I have used w2v and only done vectorization for 1000 data pts as the file was too big for it.

The features are of 50 dimensions

A csv file is added for someone to see how the data will look afterwards
